       "['“By definition all scientists are data scientists. In my opinion, they are half hacker, half analyst, they use data to build products and find insights. It’s Columbus meet Columbo―starry-eyed explorers and skeptical detectives.”',\n",
       " '“‘Possessed’ is probably the right word. I often tell people, ‘I don’t want to necessarily be a data scientist. You just kind of are a data scientist. You just can’t help but look at that data set and go, ‘I feel like I need to look deeper. I feel like that’s not the right fit.’”',\n",
       " '“I think of data science as more like a practice than a job. Think of the scientific method, where you have to have a problem statement, generate a hypothesis, collect data, analyze data and then communicate the results and take action…. If you just use the scientific method as a way to approach data-intensive projects, I think you’re more apt to be successful with your outcome.”',\n",
       " '“As a data scientist, I can predict what is likely to happen, but I cannot explain why it is going to happen. I can predict when someone is likely to attrite, or respond to a promotion, or commit fraud, or pick the pink button over the blue button, but I cannot tell you why that’s going to happen. And I believe that the inability to explain why something is going to happen is why I struggle to call ‘data science’ a science.”',\n",
       " '“Data scientists are kind of like the new Renaissance folks, because data science is inherently multidisciplinary.”',\n",
       " '“Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.”',\n",
       " '“As data scientists, our job is to extract signal from noise.”',\n",
       " '“The job of the data scientist is to ask the right questions. If I ask a question like ‘how many clicks did this link get?’ which is something we look at all the time, that’s not a data science question. It’s an analytics question. If I ask a question like, ‘based on the previous history of links on this publisher’s site, can I predict how many people from France will read this in the next three hours?’ that’s more of a data science question.”',\n",
       " '“A data scientist does model-driven analyses of our data; analyzes to improve our planning, increase our productivity, and develop our deeper levels of subject matter expertise. A data scientist works at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, sharing insights with the business.”',\n",
       " '“[Data scientists are] able to think of ways to use data to solve problems that otherwise would have been unsolved, or solved using only intuition.”',\n",
       " '“What sort of personality makes for an effective data scientist? Definitely curiosity…. The biggest question in data science is ‘Why?’ Why is this happening? If you notice that there’s a pattern, ask, “Why?” Is there something wrong with the data or is this an actual pattern going on? Can we conclude anything from this pattern? A natural curiosity will definitely give you a good foundation.”',\n",
       " '“There is a saying, ‘A jack of all trades and a master of none.’ When it comes to being a data scientist you need to be a bit like this, but perhaps a better saying would be, ‘A jack of all trades and a master of some.’”',\n",
       " '“My number one piece of advice always is to follow your passions first. Know what you are good at and what you care about, and pursue that…. As a successful data scientist, your day can begin and end with you counting your blessings that you are living your dream by solving real-world problems with data.”',\n",
       " '“The No. 1 thing is you’ve got to have passion. This rich passion for going ruthlessly after the problem and being deeply intellectually honest with yourself about whether this is a reasonable answer….',\n",
       " '“Nobody ever talks about motivation in learning. Data science is a broad and fuzzy field, which makes it hard to learn. Really hard. Without motivation, you’ll end up stopping halfway through and believing you can’t do it, when the fault isn’t with you―it’s with the teaching.',\n",
       " '“I do not know how you teach someone to love to learn, but being self-motivated is integral to this field. Once you have the core concepts, to be able to be really excited about, and continue to seek out, new information is something that I look for, for example, when we are recruiting people.”',\n",
       " '“You can best learn data mining and data science by doing, so start analyzing data as soon as you can! However, don’t forget to learn the theory, since you need a good statistical and machine learning foundation to understand what you are doing and to find real nuggets of value in the noise of big data.”',\n",
       " '“Learning how to do data science is like learning to ski. You have to do it.”',\n",
       " '“Data science’s learning curve is formidable. To a great degree, you will need a degree, or something substantially like it, to prove you’re committed to this career….',\n",
       " '“In my view, success for data science professionals relies on becoming trained and able data scientists with the ability to perform data processing and computation at a massive scale. To achieve this, professionals must invest time in ongoing education through institutions with multidisciplinary programs that include elements from engineering, mathematical sciences, and social sciences. Converting big data into meaningful information begins with skilled professionals who are educated in all disciplines to be both data scientists and statisticians.”',\n",
       " '“There is no bottleneck for data scientists… The bottleneck is very often for companies who don’t have a culture of working with data to actually cut down the process into the right steps.”',\n",
       " '“Once you have a certain amount of math/stats and hacking skills, it is much better to acquire a grounding in one or more subjects than in adding yet another programming language to your hacking skills, or yet another machine learning algorithm to your math/stats portfolio…. Clients will rather work with some data scientist A who understands their specific field than with another data scientist B who first needs to learn the basics―even if B is better in math/stats/hacking.”']"

If you work as a data scientist, or if you are planning to become/hire one, you’ve probably seen storytelling listed as one of the key skills that data scientists should have. Unlike ‘real’ scientists that work in academia and have to explain their results mostly to peers who can handle technical complexities, <strong>data scientists in industry have to deal with non-technical stakeholders who want to understand how the models work.</strong> However, these stakeholders rarely have the time or patience to understand how things truly work. What they want is a simple hand-wavy explanation to make them feel as if they understand the matter―<strong>they want a story, not a technical report</strong>.”</li>\n",

       "<p>These thoughts are more than just clever wordsmithing; they show us fresh ways of understanding, valuing, and breaking into this dynamic field. So, now is an excellent time to pursue a degree in the popular field of data science (more convenient, too, as data science and other up-and-coming degrees, like a <a href=\"https://onlinecounselingprograms.com/\">master’s in counseling</a> or a <a href=\"https://teach.com/how-to-become-a-teacher/get-educated/online-doctorate-in-education-edd/\">doctorate in education</a>, have recently begun to be offered online). Before you do, though, it’s a good idea to hear from a variety of perspectives on how to succeed as a data scientist, <em>especially</em> when those perspectives coincide on a few important points. So here are some key takeaways to remember:</p>\n",
       "<ol>\n",
       "<li><strong>Data science is not easy.</strong> Seems obvious enough, but as you encounter step-by-step career paths online, be aware that no single method is going to work for everyone, and the multiplicity of opinions on how to become a data scientist confirms that.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Practice, practice, practice.</strong> It absolutely doesn’t make perfect, but it’s absolutely necessary throughout the duration of your data science career.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Do your homework.</strong> Theory is essential to shape and direct the course of all that practice.</li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Learn how to effectively communicate your findings.</strong> This one speaks for itself, but your data won’t.</li>\n",
